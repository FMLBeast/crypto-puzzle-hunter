This pattern describes the Arweave Puzzle Series, including common techniques and orchestrated solution approaches.

The Arweave Puzzle Series consists of multiple puzzle weaves (Puzzle Weave 1, 2, 4, 8, 13, etc.) that combine various cryptographic techniques, mathematical problems, and blockchain-related challenges.

Common characteristics:
1. Multi-layered puzzles requiring solving several steps
2. Combination of mathematical riddles, cryptographic challenges, and blockchain concepts
3. References to Arweave blockchain technology and terminology
4. May include hidden data in images, HTML, or transaction payloads
5. Often requires cross-referencing information from multiple sources

Solution approaches:
1. Algebra Module: Set up and solve linear systems automatically
2. Brute-Force Timer: Script loops over timestamps to detect patterns
3. Riddle Lookup: Store classic riddle-answer pairs for quick retrieval
4. Coordinate Calculation: Compute and format geographic coordinates
5. Vision API: Analyze images to extract spatial data or hidden information
6. Arweave Fetch: Automate HTTP calls to pull transaction data
7. Toolchain Wrapper: Invoke forensics tools programmatically
8. Steganalysis Library: Detect hidden content in files
9. Decryption Module: Attempt decryption with metadata-derived keys
10. Linear Program Solver: Solve inequality-bound problems
11. Combinatorics Function: Calculate probabilities with combinatorial formulas
12. Knowledge Graph Query: Connect to domain-specific information graphs
13. Timeline API: Match dates with historical events
14. LLM-Agent Loop: Combine text analysis with API calls
15. File-Type Router: Detect MIME types and dispatch to appropriate analysis pipelines

Examples from the series:
- Puzzle Weave 1: Solving algebraic equations (Sam + Kyle = total; Sam - Kyle = difference)
- Puzzle Weave 1: Finding the 99th beep in a countdown-beep pattern at 10:01
- Puzzle Weave 2: Extracting hidden archives or steganographic content from Arweave transaction data
- Puzzle Weave 4: Setting up inequalities to find minimum shares in an AR-Distribution riddle
- Puzzle Weave 8: Cross-referencing biographical hints and historical events
- Puzzle Weave 13: Analyzing on-chain data with appropriate tools based on file type
