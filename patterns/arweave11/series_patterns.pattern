This pattern describes common techniques and themes used in the Arweave11 puzzle series.

The Arweave11 series is known for combining multiple cryptographic techniques and often includes references to blockchain technology and decentralized storage.

Common characteristics:
1. Multi-layered puzzles that require solving several steps
2. References to Arweave blockchain concepts and terminology
3. Often includes steganography in combination with traditional ciphers
4. May contain wallet addresses or transaction hashes as keys or clues

Solution approaches:
1. Look for blockchain-related information first (addresses, hashes, block numbers)
2. Check for steganography in images, especially in logos or diagrams
3. Pay attention to file metadata and hidden comments in HTML/code
4. Consider the possibility of multiple encryption layers

Examples from previous puzzles in the series:
- In "Arweave11 Challenge 1", the key was derived from a specific block height
- "Bodhi's Puzzle" contained a message hidden in HTML comments that needed to be decoded with a key from the image
- The "Permaweb Puzzle" used the first letters of each paragraph to form an Arweave wallet address
- In "Arweave11 Challenge 3", the solution required finding a transaction ID hidden in the image and using it as a Vigen√®re key
